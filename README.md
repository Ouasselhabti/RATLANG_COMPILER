## Overview

Rat is a programming language developed as a teaching tool to help learners understand various aspects of programming language design, syntax analysis, type checking, and memory management. The language is designed to be simple and easy to follow while showcasing key concepts.

This repository contains the abstract syntax tree (AST) for the Rat language in multiple phases: syntax analysis, identifier analysis, type checking, and memory placement. It serves as a reference for educational purposes and can be used as a starting point for experimenting with programming language concepts.

## Features

- Syntax tree representation of the Rat programming language in various analysis phases.
- Clear separation of syntax analysis, identifier analysis, type checking, and memory placement phases.
- Demonstrates the parsing and analysis of expressions, conditionals, loops, and function declarations.
- Provides examples of handling types, memory allocation, and memory addressing.
- Offers a foundation for educational exploration of programming languages.
